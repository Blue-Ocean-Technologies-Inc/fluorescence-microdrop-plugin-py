"""Qt-free firmware uploader for the fluorescence board.

Ported from fluorescence-camera-ui's upload_firmware.py so the backend does
not depend on a script living in another repo; only the firmware SOURCE tree
stays external (the request's firmware_dir points at it). Files are pushed
with mpremote, one command per ``python -m mpremote`` subprocess: that keeps
mpremote's sys.argv/SystemExit machinery out of the backend process and lets
each command's output be captured for the caller's log.

Every function takes a ``log`` callable for progress lines (the firmware
upload service publishes them to FIRMWARE_UPLOAD_LOG) and ``upload_firmware``
honours a ``cancel_event`` between steps — mid-command cancellation is
bounded by MPREMOTE_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_S.
