"""Constants for the ROI intensity-analysis subpackage."""

#: Background annulus: how far outside the ROI edge it starts, and how
#: thick it is, in pixels. The gap exists because fluorescence bleeds a
#: pixel or two past the boundary and that halo is not background.
RING_GAP_PX = 2
RING_THICKNESS_PX = 4

#: Default rolling-ball radius (px): the scale of unevenness removed
#: from the whole frame before any ROI is measured. Comfortably larger
#: than a droplet, or the ball rolls over the signal too.
ROLLING_BALL_RADIUS_PX = 50

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# (min, max) bounds of every user-editable number. Each is read by the
# model trait AND by the spinner that edits it — and, for the ball, by
# the canvas drag that sets it — so one definition keeps the copies
# from drifting apart.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#: Ring gap / thickness (px). Gap may be 0 (ring hugs the shape); the
#: ring itself needs at least one pixel of width to exist.
RING_GAP_BOUNDS_PX = (0, 50)
RING_THICKNESS_BOUNDS_PX = (1, 50)
#: Rolling-ball radius (px): below 5 the ball is smaller than the
#: features it must clear; 500 exceeds any unevenness a frame carries.
ROLLING_BALL_RADIUS_BOUNDS_PX = (5, 500)
#: Per-ROI plot opacity, as a percentage.
ROI_ALPHA_BOUNDS_PCT = (0, 100)
#: Hampel outlier test: how far from the local median counts (in
#: scaled MADs, so 3 reads like "3 sigma"), and the window it is
#: judged in (odd sizes centre; 3 is the fewest with any neighbours).
OUTLIER_THRESHOLD_BOUNDS_MAD = (1.0, 20.0)
OUTLIER_THRESHOLD_MAD = 3.0
OUTLIER_WINDOW_BOUNDS_PTS = (3, 51)
OUTLIER_WINDOW_PTS = 5
#: Savitzky-Golay smoothing: points per polynomial fit and its order
#: (the filter itself needs order < window; 6 is past any curvature a
#: capture series shows).
SAVGOL_WINDOW_BOUNDS_PTS = (3, 101)
SAVGOL_WINDOW_PTS = 7
SAVGOL_ORDER_BOUNDS = (1, 6)
SAVGOL_ORDER = 2
#: Butterworth smoothing: filter order (8 is already a sharp cliff)
#: and cutoff as a fraction of the Nyquist frequency (1.0 would pass
#: everything; 0.99 keeps the filter well-posed).

ROI_CONFIG_FILENAME = "roi_config.json"

#: Cadence (ms) of the GUI-thread timer draining finished batch results
#: into the model. Fine-grained on purpose: the drain itself is cheap
#: (the expensive redraw is coalesced separately), and a coarser tick
#: is what made the count jump in chunks rather than climb.
ANALYSIS_RESULT_DRAIN_INTERVAL_MS = 50

#: Coalescing delay (ms) between an analysis-state notification and the
#: plot redraw — a drain burst paints once.
ROI_PLOT_COALESCE_MS = 100

#: The same delay while a batch is running. A redraw refits every ROI
#: over the whole series, which measurably crowds the GUI thread: at
#: the idle cadence the redraws queue back to back and the progress
#: readout the user is watching never gets painted.
ROI_PLOT_BATCH_COALESCE_MS = 1000

#: Wheel-zoom step on the plot canvas: one notch multiplies the span
#: by this going in, and by its reciprocal going out. Matches the
#: image canvas's 1.25/0.8 so the two feel the same.
PLOT_ZOOM_STEP = 0.8

#: Below this the plot canvas stops shrinking and the plot pane's
#: scroll area takes over with scrollbars instead.
ROI_PLOT_CANVAS_MIN_WIDTH = 300
ROI_PLOT_CANVAS_MIN_HEIGHT = 200

#: Height the plot pane's controls open at. They share a splitter with
#: the chart and the table, so this is a starting point the user drags
#: from, not a cap — the controls scroll inside whatever height they
#: end up with.
ROI_PLOT_CONTROLS_MAX_HEIGHT = 180

#: section away, large enough to grab its handle again.

#: Experiment subfolder the heater plugin writes its JSONL logs into.

HEATER_SAMPLE_MARGIN_S = 60.0

#: The sensor choice averaging every thermistor on a log line.
HEATER_SENSOR_MEAN = "mean"

#: Averaging window (ms) for the heater join: a capture's temperature
#: is the mean of every sample within ±window/2 of it — how generous
#: the match in time is allowed to be when the two clocks don't line
#: up sample-for-sample. Milliseconds, for fine-grained control at
#: burst cadences. 0 means exact: linear interpolation at the capture
#: instant. The ceiling (5 min) comfortably spans any logger dropout.
