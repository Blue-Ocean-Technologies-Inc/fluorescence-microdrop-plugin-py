"""Off-GUI batch computation: a daemon orchestrator thread (the plugin's
established off-GUI pattern) fans the images out to a lazily-created,
persistent thread pool and streams results back through a thread-safe
queue that the dock pane's drain timer empties on the GUI thread.

Threads, not processes. The work is cv2 and numpy, both of which drop
the GIL, and measured against a process pool threads returned their
first result 17x sooner on small frames (0.03 s against 0.50 s) and
finished a 60-frame 1200x1600 batch in 1.20 s against 1.96 s. Spawn
also made every worker re-import the launcher on Windows, running the
app's self-update and leaving stray processes behind.

The pool is created once (module-level, lock-guarded) and reused, so
it is never shut down. One batch at a time:
start() cancels any running one and swaps in a fresh queue, so a
superseded batch's stragglers die with the old queue."""
